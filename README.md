# System-Design
Projects from my System Design and Analysis class (2020)

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project consisted of a client who wanted to create an online drivers training course. Pending upon the package purchased the course is all online and would allow for customers to schedule in person training as well. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think that my strong suite in these projects was UML design. In my own mind I find that I have an easy time of visualizing a system or code and putting it into a diagram.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would revise my busines documentation to make it a bit more readable to a non-technical audience and to make it less chaotic in general. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what the user said he wanted in the interview and started to build the system based on this. If there were gaps in the design of the system I would fill them in with something functional. It is always important to consider the user's needs when designing because if you don't you have an unhappy customer. Having unhappy customers isn't the best business model. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach design by first looking at what functional requirements I have or need. From there I add in the non-functional things that the user wants. After I have identified my requirements I continue to connect everything and see how each of them would work in an overarching system. Once I have a handle on that I begin to shave off the rough edges of they system by applying my limitations. From there it is basically just the Agile software lifecyle comming into play again and again.
